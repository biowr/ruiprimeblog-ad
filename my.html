      <p>Street parking spots for automobiles are a scarce commodity in most urban environments. The heterogeneity of car sizes makes it inefficient to rigidly define fixed-sized spots. Instead, unmarked streets in cities like New York leave placement decisions to individual drivers, who have no direct incentive to maximize street utilization.  In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of two different behavioral interventions designed to encourage better parking, namely (1) educational campaigns to encourage parkers to "kiss the bumper" and reduce the distance between themselves and their neighbors, or (2) painting appropriately-spaced markings on the street and urging drivers to "hit the line". Through analysis and simulation, we establish that the greatest densities are achieved when lines are painted to create spots roughly twice the length of average-sized cars. Kiss-the-bumper campaigns are in principle more effective than hit-the-line for equal degrees of compliance, although we believe that the visual cues of painted lines induce better parking behavior.</p>

   Background: Colon cancer (CC) is a common gastrointestinal malignant tumor with high heterogeneity in clinical behavior and response to treatment, making individualized survival prediction challenging. Ferroptosis is a newly discovered iron-dependent cell death that plays a critical role in cancer biology. Therefore, identifying a prognostic biomarker with ferroptosis-related genes provides a new strategy to guide precise clinical decision-making in CC patients.
   </li> <li>
   Methods: Alteration in the expression profile of ferroptosis-related genes was initially screened in GSE39582 dataset involving 585 CC patients. Univariate Cox regression analysis and LASSO-penalized Cox regression analysis were combined to further identify a novel ferroptosis-related gene signature for overall survival prediction. The prognostic performance of the signature was validated in the GSE17536 dataset by Kaplan-Meier survival curve and time-dependent ROC curve analyses. Functional annotation of the signature was explored by integrating GO and KEGG enrichment analysis, GSEA analysis and ssGSEA analysis. Furthermore, an outcome risk nomogram was constructed considering both the gene signature and the clinicopathological features.
    </li> <li>
   Results: The prognostic signature biomarker composed of 9 ferroptosis-related genes accurately discriminated high-risk and low-risk patients with CC in both the training and validation datasets. The signature was tightly linked to clinicopathological features and possessed powerful predictive ability for distinct clinical subgroups. Furthermore, the risk score was confirmed to be an independent prognostic factor for CC patients by multivariate Cox regression analysis ( p value < 0.05). Functional annotation analyses showed that the prognostic signature was closely correlated with pivotal cancer hallmarks, particularly cell cycle, transcriptional regulation, and immune-related functions. Moreover, a nomogram with the signature was also built to quantify outcome risk for each patient.
    </li><li>
   Conclusion: The novel ferroptosis-related gene signature biomarker can be utilized for predicting individualized prognosis, optimizing survival risk assessment and facilitating personalized management of CC patients.

      <p>Karger used spanning tree packings [D. R. Karger, J. ACM, 47 (2000), pp. 46--76] to derive a near linear-time randomized algorithm for the global minimum cut problem as well as a bound on the number of approximate minimum cuts. This is a different approach from his well-known random contraction algorithm [D. R. Karger, Random Sampling in Graph Optimization Problems, Ph.D. thesis, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 1995, D. R. Karger and C. Stein, J. ACM, 43 (1996), pp. 601--640]. Thorup developed a fast deterministic algorithm for the minimum <span class="math">k</span>-cut problem via greedy recursive tree packings [M. Thorup, Minimum <span class="math">k</span>-way cuts via deterministic greedy tree packing, in Proceedings of the Fortieth Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, ACM, 2008, pp. 159--166].
In this paper we revisit properties of an LP relaxation for cͅut proposed by Naor and Rabani [Tree packing and approximating <span class="math">k</span>-cuts, in Proceedings of the Twelfth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, Vol. 103, SIAM, Philadelphia, 2001, pp. 26--27], and analyzed in [C. Chekuri, S. Guha, and J. Naor, SIAM J. Discrete Math., 20 (2006), pp. 261--271]. We show that the dual of the LP yields a tree packing that, when combined with an upper bound on the integrality gap for the LP, easily and transparently extends Karger's analysis for mincut to the <span class="math">k</span>-cut problem. In addition to the simplicity of the algorithm and its analysis, this allows us to improve the running time of Thorup's algorithm by a factor of <span class="math">n</span>. We also improve the bound on the number of <span class="math">\alpha</span>-approximate <span class="math">k</span>-cuts. Second, we give a simple proof that the integrality gap of the LP is <span class="math">2(1-1/n)</span>. Third, we show that an optimum solution to the LP relaxation, for all values of <span class="math">k</span>, is fully determined by the principal sequence of partitions of the input graph. This allows us to relate the LP relaxation to the Lagrangean relaxation approach of Barahona [Oper. Res. Lett., 26 (2000), pp. 99--105] and Ravi and Sinha [European J. Oper. Res., 186 (2008), pp. 77--90]; it also shows that the idealized recursive tree packing considered by Thorup gives an optimum dual solution to the LP.</p>

      <p>The capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) is one of the most well known NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. Single depot CVRP with a general metric is NP-hard even for fixed capacity 3, while polynomial time solvable for fixed capacity 2. We consider the variant of CVRP where restocking is available. We show that if there is a constant number of depots, then the problem can be solved in polynomial time when capacity is <span class="math">2</span>.</p>

      <p>In this thesis, we consider cut and connectivity problems on graphs, digraphs, hypergraphs and hedgegraphs. The main results are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>We introduce a faster algorithm for finding the reduced graph in element-connectivity computations. We also show its application to node separation.</li>
<li>We present several results on hypergraph cuts, including (a) a near linear time algorithm for finding a (2 + ε)-approximate min-cut, (b) an algorithm to find a representation of all min-cuts in the same time as finding a single min-cut, (c) a sparse subgraph that preserves connectivity for hypergraphs and (d) a near linear-time hypergraph cut sparsifier.</li>
<li>We design the first randomized polynomial time algorithm for the hypergraph <span class="math">k</span>-cut problem whose complexity has been open for over 20 years. The algorithm generalizes to hedgegraphs with constant span.</li>
<li>We address the complexity gap between global vs. fixed-terminal cuts problems in digraphs by presenting a <span class="math">2-\frac{1}{448}</span> approximation algorithm for the global bicut problem.</li>
</ul>
